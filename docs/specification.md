# HaiLuoAI Video Generator Assistant Specification

## Overview
The HaiLuoAI Video Generator Assistant is a Chrome extension designed to automate and streamline the process of generating videos on the HaiLuoAI platform (https://hailuoai.com/video).

## Features
1. Queue Management
   - Add prompts to a queue with a specified count
   - Edit existing prompts and counts in the queue
   - Remove items from the queue

2. Automated Processing
   - Start and stop the automated processing of the queue
   - Inject prompts into the HaiLuoAI interface
   - Monitor the availability status of the video generation system

3. Status Monitoring
   - Check the availability status every 2 seconds
   - Display countdown timers for next status check and next injection attempt

4. User Interface
   - Inject a custom UI into the HaiLuoAI video generation page
   - Display the current queue, status, and countdown timers

## Technical Details
- The extension uses content scripts to inject the UI and functionality into the target page
- Local storage is used to persist the queue and processing status between page reloads
- The extension monitors the presence of a loading animation to determine system availability
- Prompts are injected using direct value assignment and event dispatching to work with potential React-based interfaces

## Limitations
- The extension is specifically designed for the HaiLuoAI video generation page and may not work on other pages or sites
- The injection of the UI depends on finding specific elements in the HaiLuoAI page structure

## Future Improvements
- Implement error handling for network issues or unexpected page structures
- Add support for managing multiple queues
- Implement a more robust method for detecting system availability
- Add options for customizing the injection timing and status check intervals
